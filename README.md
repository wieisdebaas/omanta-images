# omanta

A native file manager for [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org), built with Qt Quick
and GIO as a drop-in replacement for GNOME Files (Nautilus) — same
keybindings, same launch semantics, same D-Bus integration, themed by your
Omarchy theme.

> **Testing preview.** omanta installs *alongside* your existing file manager
> and stays out of the way until you choose it. The only thing it adds by
> itself is a switch in the Omarchy Toggle menu. The switch flips between the
> two and restores the stock setup byte-identically. Please file issues for
> anything that doesn't behave exactly as you'd expect.

## What you get

- List and grid views, tabs, split view (F3), tree expansion, breadcrumbs +
  Ctrl+L, type-ahead, configurable columns
- Adjustable icon sizes in both views: Ctrl++ / Ctrl+- to resize, Ctrl+0
  to reset, or use View Options → Icon Size. List and grid each keep their
  own size, shared by every window and remembered after a restart.
- Theme-coloured folders with two-tone panels and special-location symbols;
  small icons simplify their detail for clarity.
- All write operations — copy/cut/paste (system clipboard, interops with
  other file managers), move, rename, batch rename, trash, delete — with
  undo/redo and a progress popover
- Thumbnails (images, video, PDF) via the freedesktop spec, sharing the
  system-wide cache
- Photo view: an image-only virtualized gallery with prioritized asynchronous
  loading, progressive full-photo preview, persistent multi-resolution
  thumbnails (runtime-benchmarked WebP or PNG), and a bounded decoded-image
  cache
- Places sidebar: devices with mount/unmount/eject, Network (`smb://`,
  `sftp://`) with credential prompts, Trash, Recent, Starred, bookmarks.
  F9 shows or hides it, and the choice is remembered. In a narrow window
  (tiled side by side on a laptop, say) it tucks itself away; F9 or the
  sidebar button slides it back over the files.
- Hidden files: Ctrl+H or Preferences → Show Hidden Files, remembered
  after a restart
- Quick preview: Space (or right-click → Preview) shows the selected file in
  Sushi, the previewer stock Omarchy ships — zoomable images, text,
  Markdown, PDF, audio, video, and office files when LibreOffice is
  installed. Arrow keys step through the folder; Space or Escape closes it
- Search: recursive filename plus full-text (via `localsearch`), date and
  type filters
- Compress/extract (zip, tar.xz, 7z, encrypted zip), "Extract to…"
- Omarchy theming end to end — follows your active theme live, not just
  light/dark
- Custom context-menu actions from simple TOML files — no extension API
  needed (Omarchy's transcode/LocalSend/Omarchy-Send menu items ship
  included, plus Dropbox share links if you use Dropbox)
- Multi-window single instance, `org.freedesktop.FileManager1` — "open
  containing folder" from browsers and other apps just works

Completed work from a failed or cancelled copy/move remains undoable when it
has not replaced existing files. These partial batches cannot be redone.
Extraction Undo preserves later additions, edits, and replacement files by
refusing to remove an output that has changed.

## Install

### Install this photo-view version on Omarchy

Build this repository directly so the installed copy includes the photo view:

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel git cmake ninja qt6-base qt6-declarative \
  qt6-svg qt6-imageformats glib2 gvfs libarchive tinysparql
git clone https://github.com/wieisdebaas/omanta-images.git
cd omanta-images
./bin/install
~/.local/bin/omanta-switch omanta
```

This installs user-locally under `~/.local`, leaves Nautilus installed, and
adds the Omanta toggle to Omarchy. Ensure `~/.local/bin` is on `PATH`; Omarchy
normally configures this already. After pulling future changes, rerun
`./bin/install`; the installed launcher points at this checkout's build.

To return to Nautilus without removing the build:

```bash
~/.local/bin/omanta-switch nautilus
```

### Install an official release

Grab the package from the [latest release](https://github.com/28allday/omanta/releases)
and install it:

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/28allday/omanta/releases/download/v0.1.20/omanta-0.1.20-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst
sudo pacman -U omanta-0.1.20-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst
```

(The package is unsigned, so pacman won't install it straight from a URL —
download it first and install the local file.)

Or build it yourself:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/28allday/omanta.git
cd omanta/packaging
makepkg -si
```

On ARM (aarch64 — Arch Linux ARM, Asahi, ARM laptops and VMs) there is no
prebuilt package yet, so build it this way. The code has nothing
architecture-specific, and `makepkg` needs only `base-devel` plus the
build tools it installs for you.

Installing changes none of your defaults — Nautilus (or whatever you use)
remains the file manager until you switch.

## Switching

The first time you open omanta, it adds an **Omanta File Manager** row to
the Omarchy Toggle menu (`SUPER+CTRL+O`). Select it to switch either way.
It shows a ✓ while omanta is the default, so the menu doubles as a status
check. If you remove the row, omanta won't add it back.

omanta's **Preferences → Default File Manager** has the same controls:
one switch makes omanta the default, the other shows or hides the
Toggle-menu row.

From a terminal:

```bash
omanta-switch omanta     # make omanta the default
omanta-switch nautilus   # back to stock
omanta-switch toggle     # flip
omanta-switch status     # what's active right now
```

`omanta-switch install-menu` and `omanta-switch remove-menu` add and remove
the Toggle-menu row. The row appears or disappears straight away, with no
shell restart.

Switching makes omanta (or Nautilus) the default everywhere at once:
`SUPER+SHIFT+F`, folders opened from other apps, and double-clicked
archives. It works by flipping the xdg-mime defaults and writing a
managed, clearly-marked block to `~/.config/hypr/bindings.lua` —
Omarchy's own files are never modified, no logout needed, and switching
back restores your configuration byte-for-byte. One note: whichever file
manager has windows open keeps the "open containing folder" D-Bus
service until its last window closes, so close the other one's windows
after switching.

## Uninstall

```bash
omanta-switch nautilus && omanta-switch remove-menu   # stock default, no menu row
sudo pacman -R omanta
```

## Requirements

Arch with Omarchy. Dependencies (`qt6-base`, `qt6-declarative`, `glib2`,
`gvfs`, `libarchive`, `tinysparql`) are all in Omarchy's default install or
pulled automatically. Optional: `gvfs-smb`/`gvfs-mtp`/`gvfs-gphoto2` for
network shares, phones and cameras, `ffmpegthumbnailer` for video
thumbnails, `localsearch` for full-text search.

## Hacking on it

These scripts work from any directory:

```bash
./bin/build      # cmake + ninja into build/, then run ./build/omanta
./bin/test       # the headless suites (ctest, ~25s)
./bin/test-sanitizers # Clang ASan, UBSan and leak checks
./bin/install    # user-local install: ~/.local/bin symlink, desktop entry, icon
```

`./bin/install` never touches `/usr` or pacman, and installs alongside your
existing file manager — later rebuilds are picked up without reinstalling. For
a real package instead, use the `makepkg -si` route above.

Requires `cmake`, `ninja` and the Qt 6 development packages in addition to the
runtime dependencies above.

The Empty Trash integration test also needs `bubblewrap` and GVfs. It runs
with a separate filesystem, home directory and D-Bus session; it is skipped
when those dependencies are unavailable. The full-disk and permission tests
also require `bubblewrap`. See the [validation report](docs/validation-v0.1.13.md)
for the latest integration checks and their limits.
